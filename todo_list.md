# Project Todo List

## Contracts Module Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Contract Editing Experience
- [ ] Replace the standard `<textarea>` for editable sections with a rich-text editor (e.g., CKEditor).
- [ ] Modify the UI to allow for a more intuitive "in-place" editing experience.

### 2. Improved Contract Display
- [ ] Redesign the contract view to resemble a formal document (e.g., two-column layout, header).
- [ ] Add visual cues to distinguish between editable and non-editable sections.

### 3. Streamlined Signing and Finalization Process
- [ ] Create a new, read-only "Review and Sign" page.
- [ ] Add a designated area for digital signatures.
- [ ] Implement contract locking after both parties have signed.
- [ ] Add a "Download as PDF" option for finalized contracts.

### 4. Clearer Contract Status and Workflow
- [ ] Introduce clear status labels for each contract (e.g., "Draft," "Awaiting Signature," "Finalized").
- [ ] Implement status-dependent action buttons for each contract.
